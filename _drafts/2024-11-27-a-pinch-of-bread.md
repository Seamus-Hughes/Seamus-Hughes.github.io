## A Pinch of Bread. 

A couple of years ago I gave up beef. There was no fan fair, no preaching to the unradicalised
Masses, no fuss. In fact I took great care not to make it an issum. I tend to find that you add an issum to the end of a thing it just starts to get a little bit ugly and unpleasant.

I gave up beef for one simple reason. 

> One again the vastly disproportionate impact of beef is obvious. If you want to do one thing to immediately reduce your carbon emissions, stop eating beef. You can do that today, at no cost.
