#### Friday 17th January 

> “It’s quite plastic. Is that what old school Doctor Who used to be like?”[^19]\
> — Child 1

[^19]: I’m there for movie night and they can’t decide, so we watch “Honey, I Shrunk The Kids.” ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (1 for nostalgia’s sake.) Alaya and Robyn were really engaged. Great kid-level adventure story. Loved the ant part (effects and story). Some great physical humor. The effects didn’t age well - all practical effects, some animation and model work. So yes, this is how Doctor Who was.

#### Thursday 16th January 

> So while I was quietly reading my book, Child 3 and a friend managed to acquire food from someone else’s party.[^18]

[^18]: I found this quite stressful and I didn’t know what to do. The parents at the table of the party we were at were less bothered and found it quite amusing. By the time they had their second helping of party food, I wasn’t too bothered. They both enjoyed themselves, apart from being chased around by the girls. They are at the age where I can’t imagine there are many more soft-play parties in the offing.

#### Wednesday 15th January 

> “What do you mean, you winked at her?”[^17]\
> — Myself to a workmate after her interview.

[^17]: I didn’t know they were even interviewing. She was clearly decompressing when she offloaded in a rather jolly way about how it went. Thinking she didn’t take it seriously enough compared to everyone else, her nerves got the better of her, culminating in the wink. It didn’t do her any harm. She got the job.

#### Tuesday 14th January 

> Then, just like that, he was gone.[^16]

[^16]: When the message came through that Damien had died suddenly and unexpectedly, I was completely knocked for six. I’ve known him for a good 20 years, and he was one of those characters that you felt would be an eternal presence. I just knew him. For many, many others, he was a close and good friend too. He is one of those people where you can’t imagine there would be a big enough church for his funeral. And I doubt very much that there is.

#### Monday 13th January

> When you’re searching around for a clear distinction between leadership and management, then both are clearly lacking. Nothing fills that hole other than an echo of what could be, drowned out by the chaos of what is.[^15]

[^15]: I’m struggling with the concept of the management class: the distance and detachment from what they are managing. Also, nobody manages to an efficiency that does themselves out of a job; quite the opposite, it appears.

#### Sunday 12th January

> “At Year 4, they turn into little bitches.”[^14]\
> — My Better Half

[^14]: We were chatting with my better half’s friend about the horrors of sleepovers and what the kids were like at the craft party. Some of Child 2’s friends are downright rude and don’t even know it. Cat had to put her teacher voice on more than once. Her friend knew of a sleepover that went so bad the girls (slightly older) ended up outside in the middle of the night and had to sleep in separate rooms eventually.

#### Saturday 11th January

> “Break Glass.”[^13]\
> — Knuckles in Sonic the Hedgehog 3

[^13]: When Sonic tries to convince Knuckles his role is to break the glass in case of an emergency, all Knuckles fixates on is the breaking glass part. I’d give it a split ⭐️⭐️⭐️. For a kids’ franchise, there was significant time and effort made to add some quality comic moments, emotional heft, and strong characterization. Child 1 laughed out loud more than once, and Child 3 still thinks “Paddington in Peru” was better.

#### Friday 10th January

> Me: “How did it go?” \
> \
> Child 2: “I got the dojos!”[^10]\
> \
> Me: [genuine fist in the air and cheering out loud moment]\
> \
> Me: “Well done.”\
> \
> Me: “Great plan, well executed.”[^11] [^12]

[^10]: Dojos are the standard way for primary schools to reward (bribe) kids into behaving, doing what they are told, and stretching their results. They get dished out and at the end of the week counted up, and the winner gets a prize. As a side note: if your kid always gets the prize at the end of the week, it may be that they’re not always on their best behavior at school.

[^11]: I got home last night and Child 2 handed me a book that she had written, with front and back cover and pictures. My job was to staple it together. I commented how impressed I was, and indeed it was impressive. “It was homework,” she said. Really? So she let me know the plan: “Well, we had to write what we thought might happen to Omar. However, X has one more dojo than me, and she always wins. So if I do this, I might get two dojos.” And she did and won the prize.

[^12]: It was such a good idea, one of her friends stole it, and as a reward, her friend got a shout-out in assembly and Child 2 didn’t. She took poorly to the counsel that she should just accept sometimes, when you have ideas as good as that, people are going to be inspired and also get rewarded for them.

#### Thursday 9th January 

> There was a huge crash from one of the bedrooms. I dashed up thinking a child had ‘fallen’ from their bed,[^8] but no - it was a child-sized pile of books falling off Child 1’s bed.[^9]

[^8]: The night before, Child 3 proclaimed he was doing something really unusual, followed by an almighty crash from his room. I rushed in and he was there by his bed in a heap on the floor. Once we established he was okay, it appeared that he was imagining the shelf on the side of his bed was an elevator. He was sitting on it waiting for it to go down. It gave way and did just that.

[^9]: Child 1 is an avid reader, and her rather large box of books was overflowing so much that it overflowed off the bunk bed and left an untidy pile on the floor. My bursting into the room checking if they were all right left them in fits of giggles.

#### Wednesday 8th January 

> Like everyone else, I’m getting tired and fed up of the snow and ice.[^7]

[^7]: It snowed on Saturday night. Not as deep as expected but deep enough. Child 2 enjoyed the sledging with her sleepover friends. Then it didn’t thaw. The temperature is not due to rise above freezing till the end of the week. The snow quickly compacted and became sheets of ice, visible and invisible. Every time you stepped out, that effort and time was required to get from A to B. Cycling was out of the question. A large chunk of my precious time in the morning is spent de-icing the car for my better half.

#### Tuesday 7th January 

> “You’re better at **head stories**[^6] than Daddy.”[^5]\
> — My better half to child 3

#### Monday 6th January

> I’m fine with a school almost never closing because of snow. That’s my sort of risk assessment. 
> 
> When it drops the ‘almost’ and sticks with ‘never’, that’s no risk assessment at all.[^4]

#### Sunday 5th January 

> “I’m a penis, you’re a china.”[^3]\
> — Child No. 3

#### Saturday 4th January 

> The creation of sleepovers was one of the Devil’s finest achievements.[^2]

#### Friday 3rd January 

> “I don’t think it’s the right time to make New Year’s resolutions when I can’t even figure out what day of the week it is.”[^1] \
> — Myself



[^6]: A head story is a made-up story told on the spot. But it’s more fun than that. They are free-flowing and have little respect for plot or narrative structure. If it’s fun, just throw it in, let it be a free-flowing stream of creativity.

[^5]: This is very true, some of his under-the-bed stories would give you nightmares.

[^4]: Our kids school never closes. I did a recce at 7:30. I could have got them to school. They’d have hated me for it, but we’d have got there. My partner getting them home would have been close to impossible. So apart from child 1, the others were still asleep when I left for work.

[^3]: My son is going to be such a lad. When he heard the word penis, he repeated it followed by a giggle. Then he went around calling all the girls ‘chinas’ instead of ‘vaginas’.

[^2]: Child 2’s wicked sleepover was an enjoyable affair until the not-going-to-sleep part. Whoever thought of putting children who all have their own personal, idiosyncratic ways of getting to sleep in a room together is just evil. Child 2, who gets rather grumpy when overtired, spent a couple of days recovering.

[^1]: Nice combo. Nobody remembers what day of the week it is around Christmas. Resolutions are all well and good, but post-Christmas, when there’s so much leftover food and alcoholic drinks sloshing around, it’s cold, wet, and mostly dark outside. January is always a bit of a downer. This is not the time for resolutions.
