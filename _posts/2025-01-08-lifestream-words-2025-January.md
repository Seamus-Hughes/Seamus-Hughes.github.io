### January

#### Tuesday 7th January 

> "You're better at **head stories**[^1] than Daddy."[^This is very true, some of his under-the-bed stories would give you nightmares.]\
> — My better half to child 3

#### Monday 6th January

> I'm fine with a school almost never closing because of snow. That's my sort of risk assessment. 
> 
> When it drops the 'almost' and sticks with 'never', that's no risk assessment at all.[^Our kids school never closes. I did a recce at 7:30. I could have got them to school. They'd have hated me for it, but we'd have got there. My partner getting them home would have been close to impossible. So apart from child 1, the others were still asleep when I left for work.]

#### Sunday 5th January 

> "I'm a penis, you're a china."[^My son is going to be such a lad. When he heard the word penis, he repeated it followed by a giggle. Then he went around calling all the girls 'chinas' instead of 'vaginas'.]\
> — Child No. 3

#### Saturday 4th January 

> The creation of sleepovers was one of the Devil's finest achievements.[^Child 2's wicked sleepover was an enjoyable affair until the not-going-to-sleep part. Whoever thought of putting children who all have their own personal, idiosyncratic ways of getting to sleep in a room together is just evil. Child 2, who gets rather grumpy when overtired, spent a couple of days recovering.]

#### Friday 3rd January 

> "I don't think it's the right time to make New Year's resolutions when I can't even figure out what day of the week it is."[^Nice combo. Nobody remembers what day of the week it is around Christmas. Resolutions are all well and good, but post-Christmas, when there's so much leftover food and alcoholic drinks sloshing around, it's cold, wet, and mostly dark outside. January is always a bit of a downer. This is not the time for resolutions.] \

[^1]: A head story is a made-up story told on the spot. But it’s more fun than that. They are free-flowing and have little respect for plot or narrative structure. If it’s fun, just throw it in, let it be a free-flowing stream of creativity
