I was thinking that I'd struggle to get [12 book suggestions]({% post_url 2025-01-19-book-pool %}) from the kids, forgetting that we read to them every night. 

Child 3 is transitioning from picture books. In the last 10 years, I've read many a wonderful picture book, as good or better than any other 'real' book that I've read. Many of which I'm still quite fond of and will sadly miss. He's moving on to a bit more long-form reading and has a tendency, like Child 1, for fact books. That's when his love of [head stories]({% post_url 2025-01-08-lifestream-words-2025-January %}#tuesday-7th-january) doesn't get in the way. 

Child 2's choices are, [like my better half's]({% post_url 2025-01-20-wifes-reading-recommendations-2025 %}), emotionally driven. These are the books over the last year that have been bedtime stories she has related to in an emotional way. Some of which she liked so much she read again. 

Child 1 reads more books than anyone else in the house put together. Unlike many readers, she possesses the audacious ability to abandon a book when it fails to capture her interest. Moving on without guilt or hesitation, a skill I'm quite envious of. She's tried many of the children's classics but hasn't really taken to lots of them. She's also an avid nonfiction reader, but she’s currently in a fiction reading phase.
