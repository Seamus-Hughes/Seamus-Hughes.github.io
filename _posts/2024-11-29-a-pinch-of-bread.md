A couple of years ago, I gave up beef without much fanfare, preaching or fuss. I took great care not to turn it into an "ism," knowing that adding an ideology to something can make unpalatable for all those involved. 

I gave up beef for one simple reason:

> "One again the vastly disproportionate impact of beef is obvious. If you want to do one thing to immediately reduce your carbon emissions, stop eating beef. You can do that today, at no cost." <br>

My initial intention was to give up cow completely. Looking at the graph from [Carbon Brief](https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/what-is-the-climate-impact-of-eating-meat-and-dairy/), three of the top five carbon-producing food types are cow-related.

The beef was fine, but I really struggled with milk and cheese. I loved a glass of milk, and cheese is, well, cheese. It wasn't until my daughter needed to give up milk products that we managed to make the difficult leap together.

My diet is, hopefully, about to take another radical transformation. I take medication to lower my blood pressure, a necessity following a corrected congenital heart defect that keeps me under my cardiologist's watchful eye.

The medication works, but an article in the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/nov/24/the-truth-about-salt-how-to-avoid-one-of-the-worlds-biggest-hidden-killers) reminded me that reducing daily salt intake significantly improves your hearts health and your personal longevity. 

Is there an equivalent golden cow for reducing daily salt intake?

Well, it comes down to processed meat, and surprisingly, bread.

At work, a bacon and sausage sandwich has progressed from a treat to a comfort food—one I know I need to give up. The British Heart Foundation's suggestion of mushrooms or poached egg on toast. Really, mushrooms vs bacon, is that your best offer! I might just have to go cold turkey.

A nice first step but as much as I try, I don’t have a bacon buttie every day. You want to make the biggest impact, tackle something that you eat on a daily basis.

That’s why Bread is the golden Cow of reducing salt intake. It might not have the most salt content but the fact that we eat an awful lot of the stuff is what makes the difference. 

My typical dalyish work lunch is a ham sandwich. This contains roughy 2 to 3 grams of salt, depending on the bread. Since this is a constant, it's where I can make the most significant impact.

Looks like I'll be learning to make soup and pasta dishes.
