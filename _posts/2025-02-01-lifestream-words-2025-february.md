 #### Wednesday 5th February

> I’m just a bit disengaged and bored at work at the moment.[^7]

[^7]: I’ve been in the same job for over 10 years. So long that the job has actually changed, but not enough. I need a new job. I’m looking but I don’t know what for. I’ll keep looking.

#### Tuesday 4th February 

> My Better Half: “Omg, Child 3. You are soooooo cute. I love you.”\
> \
> Myself: “He’s not been cute tonight.”[^6]

[^6]: He has his moments, but there are times tonight that he’s been anything but cute. It’s a quick turnaround from school, then he’s dragged (literally kicking and screaming tonight) to and from swimming. It’s tough on him at times. I struggled tonight.

#### Monday 3rd February 

> Me: “Child 3, what does ‘No’ mean?”\
> Child 3: “Yes!”[^5]

[^5]: My better half had received a complaint at work. He was upset. In essence, not about the complaint, but about the indirectness of it. The parent wasn’t direct; she complained to someone else. Thankfully, the school was supportive and nothing came of it. The complaint was that my better half had set boundaries in class. The kid struggled with this because they live in a home where there are clearly no boundaries. Child 3 knows the boundaries exist in our house. Mostly learned through challenging and stretching them. They might be malleable, but they still exist.

#### Sunday 2nd February 

> I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve heard “In My Own Little Corner,” but this time was the best.[^2] [^3] [^4]

[^2]: It’s the final of David Clover. Child 1 is there to sing the winning song in her class and to be presented with her trophy. The trophy is almost as tall as her, and we have no idea where to put it at home. I’m glad I got to hear her perform.

[^3]: There are two things that I enjoy watching when Child 1 performs. It’s not watching her, it’s watching the audience. There is definitely something special in the way that the audience responds: the silence during the song and the appreciation after.

[^4]: The second thing I enjoy is watching Alaya receive compliments. Genuine compliments from some of the most talented singers/teachers in the room. When this starts to happen, you know she’s got something going. That’s not the fun bit, though. The fun bit is watching Alaya receiving the compliments and having no idea what to do with it or how to respond appropriately.

#### Saturday 1st February 

> "I've got in the habit of saying the wrong thing to people," says Child 1.\
> "Me too," I reply, knowing exactly what the problem is for both of us.
