#### Friday 28th February 

> Ooh, pea gravy, can I have some of that please?[^30]

[^30]: One question for you. Who in their right mind adds peas to curry? My better half does, that’s who. She’ll put curry with peas. It’s become a running joke now. She makes a chilli, are there peas in that? I wouldn’t put it past her.

#### Tuesday 25th February

> The land was oozing water from every pore and flowing freely from every possible orifice.[^29]

[^29]: We shared a day off so we headed to [Chee Dale Stepping Stones](https://www.peakdistrict.org/chee-dale-stepping-stones-walk/) for a short walk. Little did we know how wet the route along the river would be. Even the secondary routes that people had created when the actual route was waterlogged and mud soup. I’m glad I brought the walking sticks until mine failed to function and every time the stick got stuck it pulled apart. I stubbed my finger on barbed wire and it wouldn’t stop bleeping, almost fell in the river and got so frustrated that my better half kept walking on ahead when I got stuck. We made it, the stepping stones were fun and the walk back along the Monsal Trail was much easier.

#### Monday 24th February

> Just to let you know I can’t hear for toffee.[^28]

[^28]: Coordinating at work is hard enough at the best of times. The result of putting drops in my ear has left me mostly deaf on the left-hand side. I told everyone from the get-go and we muddled through to the end. What surprised me the most was how exhausting it was.

#### Sunday 23rd February

> The art of self-construction.[^27]

[^27]: I know it’s cheap, I know everyone has it in their house, but there is something quite satisfying in putting IKEA furniture together successfully. I even managed to secure the things to the wall.

#### Saturday 22nd February

> A double bill of Theatre. **Chitty Chitty Bang Bang**[^25] ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ in the afternoon and **Macbeth**[^26] in the Evening ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

[^25]: Really loved the film, loved this. The stagecraft was great and didn’t take itself too seriously. Fair enough you get the full-sized flying car but you also get a mobile car that drives across the stage. The dog puppets were amazing. The songs are just classics. The Vulgarians, the bad guys, brought a slapstick panto humour to the mix for the better. The Child Catcher, who petrified me in the movie, could have been much scarier in the play.

[^26]: My eldest dragged me to this performance, given her obsession with Shakespeare and especially Macbeth. It took me a little time to tune into the dialogue. Once I got it, I began to understand the story, like you would if you were watching a film in a second language that has faded from your memory. The production was outstanding. The sound design alone was unreal (the audience all wore headphones), the use of a second stage and it being in the round. David Tennant was also exceptional. James at work, who watches a lot of this, said it’s the best version of Macbeth he has ever seen.

#### Friday 21st February

> “At least I’ve learned something about high flow.”[^23]\
> \
> “Really, what?”\
> \
> “I don’t actually know.”[^24]

[^23]: This is a respiratory support device that delivers warmed, humidified oxygen (or oxygen-air mixture) at high flow rates through nasal cannulas. It can generate a small amount of positive airway pressure and reduce work of breathing. It’s becoming increasingly popular as an alternative to conventional oxygen therapy and can help avoid more invasive ventilation methods.

[^24]: It’s the classic PACU Jack of all trades and master of none situation. Patients on high flow are becoming more and more regular in recovery but not regular enough to maintain a functional working knowledge that gets updated once a year. This becomes more of a problem when it’s not run-of-the-mill and the patient initially can’t maintain their saturations above 85% even when you have the high flow maxed out and supplemental face mask O2. This requires troubleshooting and problem-solving skills only acquired through frequent use of the kit. Given time, the patient recovered and ended up in HDU for close observation.

#### Thursday 20th February

> The art of KitKating that leads to the inevitable doomscrolling. [^22]

[^22]: Lunch break was mostly about TikTok. How Dani had managed to get a few hundred views from a jump cut video (created by pausing and unpausing the recording) of her last Lidl shop. Then she put a running commentary over it. We then went on to teach Sarah G what doomscrolling meant. Then I was inspired, thinking it would be great if my better half shot a similar video of our weekly shop but I do the running commentary to great comic effect. “Not another bag of bloody peas.” This went down very well. Even my better half thought it was funny, and she never thinks I’m funny.

#### Wednesday 19th February 

> The number of lives you touch isn’t always reflected in the number of people who turn up at your funeral.[^21]

[^21]: It was Damian’s funeral today. Sadly, we couldn’t make it. My better half and I had a deep and meaningful conversation about the lives we touch along the way and how that’s not always reflected in the number of mourners at one’s funeral. This reflection stems from my growing awareness that when my time comes, that there will be few if any mourners attend my funeral. Not even my better half, as she insists I don’t die first because she couldn’t cope with the alternative. I suspect my melancholy stems from having watched Damian master something I never could, building and  cultivating lasting friendships over his sadly shortened life. As my better half points out, companionship was his thing. While I know relationships aren’t my strength, and life choices like work and family play their part, envy simply signals something desired but not pursued.


#### Tuesday 18th February 

> My Better Half: “Do you think Child Three’s going to like his room?”\
> \
> Me: “No.”[^20]

[^20]: His expectations are running quite high. His imagined Pokémon room is currently just blue walls, and his bed is cluttered with shelves and boxes yet to be returned to their places. Even after all the work I’ve put in, there is still much more to do. 

#### Monday 17th February 

> Cleared the floor, used a box.[^19]

[^19]: There is a stark contrast between how my better half and I tidy. I work through everything methodically, finding each item a home or a bin. My better half starts the same way, with enthusiasm. As her enthusiasm quickly wanes, a bag becomes home for the unsorted items. Today, with only a day to paint Child Three’s room, I adopted her approach.



#### Sunday 16th February 

> “I can’t remember getting so many hugs from you in a single day,” I say to Child Two as she hugs me again before I leave for home.[^18]

[^18]: After driving the kids to their grandparents’ and sharing tea with them and my better half, I prepare to catch my train home. As I’m leaving, Child Three can’t stop hugging me. There were times when we needed a daily hug ritual to remind me she needed affection. Those daily hugs have long since gone.

#### Saturday 15th February 

> Child 2 lost at Junior Monopoly. There were tears.[^17]

[^17]: Three kids around the table played nicely without drama or incident. Child 3 fleeced is leading to tears, real tears. Child 2 has an inherent mix of luck, skill and competitive spirit when it comes to board games. She wins more than her fair share of games. Thankfully, she managed to win at Frustration afterwards, commencing what I suspect will be another extended winning streak. This partly made up for the previous upset.

#### Friday 14th February 

> The adjudicator definitely had his preferred style. He liked a more granular, textured sound from the choir. He was all for going big on the contrasts. Alexandra’s smoothly blended harmonies were truly outstanding, but they didn’t align with his vision.[^16]

[^16]: Our first time at Miss Sutherland’s singing competition in Huddersfield. The venue, the Town Hall, was a fantastic space. Their main competition (and only competition in the first class) was a choir master from Huddersfield who had been doing this for 15 years. The adjudicator’s feedback was too harsh. It was their best performance I’d heard in a while.

#### Thursday 13th February 

> My Better Half: “Do you love me?”\
> \
> Myself: “Of course I love you.”\
> \
> My Better Half: “Really?”\
> \
> Myself: “Well, now you ask...”[^15]

[^15]: It’s fair to say that I’m not as forthcoming with the affection my better half needs. Sometimes she needs to give me a gentle reminder through playful conversations like this one.

#### Wednesday 12th February 

> “Don’t worry, but he’s having some breath-holding episodes where we’re having to give him a little oxygen,” I say cautiously to the parents.\
> \
> “Is he upset when he does it?” they ask.\
> \
> **Regretting not having asked sooner**, “Yes,” I say.\
> \
> “He does that all the time, even before the accident.”[^14]

[^14]: This is one of those classic moments of reflection:
1. However good you are, parents know best
2. Documentation, observations and staff feedback provide only single points of data - unreliable at best
3. Don’t hesitate to inform parents about developments, as long as it’s done appropriately
4. Don’t hesitate to involve parents - benefits far outweigh emotional risks
5. Minimise handover gaps, as loss of details, context and continuity creates unnecessary risk

#### Tuesday 11th February

> Struggling to contain my anger, “**Action not reaction**,” I say to Child Number 2 as she is sprawled across the bedroom floor, crying out for a hug from her elder sister.[^13]

[^13]: Her brain works so differently to mine. The essence of how we process thoughts follows entirely distinct paths. Hers is emotional, mine is reason and logic. We are in the same room but we are worlds apart. A few layers up, where the mind interacts with the world and others, they are almost like foreign languages. I’ve always struggled with my own language, let alone others. I’ll work harder at understanding this one.

#### Monday 10th February

> “You annoy me so much sometimes. I really want to pour this cup of juice over your head. I probably would if I didn’t know **your brain worked differently to mine**.”[^12]\
> — My Better Half

[^12]: She wants a date to start painting Child 3’s bedroom, which really means a date to finish painting his bedroom. I’m thinking: don’t we need to clear the space in there? Don’t we need to pick a colour scheme? Don’t we need to get supplies? Let’s take it step by step. We are so different. It’s nice that my better half acknowledges this from the get-go. This doesn’t always happen, the anger and frustration, on both sides, usually gets in the way. 

#### Sunday 9th February

> “But I didn’t get...”[^11]\
> — Child Number 2

[^11]: The magical joy of the party bag holds its sway even for an 8-year-old. That is, until she realised she didn’t get the same as her younger brother. She continued to protest even when we pointed out that this wasn’t the way to show gratitude. 

#### Saturday 8th February

> How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\
> Slightly triggering and I don’t know why.[^10]

[^10]: One of those films I’d never seen but probably should have. Really liked how balanced the boy versus girl perspective is. Dialogue is sharp, humour is spot on. Nothing specific, but something about it was a **little bit triggering**. I’m guessing that most people feel that way about it, they do don’t they? I suppose that adds to the comedy of the piece.

#### Friday 7th February

> There is something about walking into a pub just before 10 to have breakfast with my better half and seeing people already halfway through their pints.[^9]

[^9]: I get that we all lead different lives. There are endless possible stories that we tell ourselves that lead us to the lives we end up living. As interesting as those stories might be and the lives they might represent, I cannot imagine a happy and coherent life for those sitting with half a pint on a cold, damp Friday morning. Also, how the hell are they able to write off a day like that. What a waste of a day.


#### Thursday 6th February 

> Patient: “I’m worried that it’ll hurt when I laugh.”\
> \
> Myself: “I’ll try not to tell any jokes.”\
> \
> Ria: “You’re in luck, Seamus isn’t funny at all.”[^8]

[^8]: It had been a tough day at work. I hadn’t been feeling as engaged or motivated as usual. This was just a nice moment with a nice patient at the end of the day.

#### Wednesday 5th February

> I’m just a bit disengaged and bored at work at the moment.[^7]

[^7]: I’ve been in the same job for over 10 years. So long that the job has actually changed, but not enough. I need a new job. I’m looking but I don’t know what for. I’ll keep looking.

#### Tuesday 4th February 

> My Better Half: “Omg, Child 3. You are soooooo cute. I love you.”\
> \
> Myself: “He’s not been cute tonight.”[^6]

[^6]: He has his moments, but there are times tonight that he’s been anything but cute. It’s a quick turnaround from school, then he’s dragged (literally kicking and screaming tonight) to and from swimming. It’s tough on him at times. I struggled tonight.

#### Monday 3rd February 

> Me: “Child 3, what does ‘No’ mean?”\
> Child 3: “Yes!”[^5]

[^5]: My better half had received a complaint at work. He was upset. In essence, not about the complaint, but about the indirectness of it. The parent wasn’t direct; she complained to someone else. Thankfully, the school was supportive and nothing came of it. The complaint was that my better half had set boundaries in class. The kid struggled with this because they live in a home where there are clearly no boundaries. Child 3 knows the boundaries exist in our house. Mostly learned through challenging and stretching them. They might be malleable, but they still exist.

#### Sunday 2nd February 

> I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve heard “In My Own Little Corner,” but this time was the best.[^2] [^3] [^4]

[^2]: It’s the final of David Clover. Child 1 is there to sing the winning song in her class and to be presented with her trophy. The trophy is almost as tall as her, and we have no idea where to put it at home. I’m glad I got to hear her perform.

[^3]: There are two things that I enjoy watching when Child 1 performs. It’s not watching her, it’s watching the audience. There is definitely something special in the way that the audience responds: the silence during the song and the appreciation after.

[^4]: The second thing I enjoy is watching Alaya receive compliments. Genuine compliments from some of the most talented singers/teachers in the room. When this starts to happen, you know she’s got something going. That’s not the fun bit, though. The fun bit is watching Alaya receiving the compliments and having no idea what to do with it or how to respond appropriately.

#### Saturday 1st February 

> “I’ve got in the habit of saying the wrong thing to people,” says Child 1.\
> “Me too,” I reply, knowing exactly what the problem is for both of us. [^1]

[^1]: My better half and I had literally had one of those “Is everything Ok with us, we seem to be grateing quite bit at the monument.” In essence the discussion boiled down to me taking what was said and down literally on one part and on the other, me saying things in a way without realising everyone else in the world apart from me thinks I’m saying the ‘wrong’ thing. I always felt that I needed a wing man to support and guide me through these conversations. I still feel like that at times. Child 1 and I might well be the same but I have 30 years on her so I’ve worked a little bit of this out. Maybe I’ll be her wing man.
