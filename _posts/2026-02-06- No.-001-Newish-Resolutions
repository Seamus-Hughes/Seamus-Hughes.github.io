# No. 001 - Newish Resolutions

(*Or how I managed to read 400% more books this year than last year*)[^1]

[^1]: 20 instead of 5, both reasonable numbers of books to read in a year.

## 1. Newish Year Resolutions 

Waiting till February to make resolutions because 
> “...January is a hangover month for recovering and catching up from the holidays, and therefore ill-suited to new endeavors in self-improvement.” 
> 
> \- [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.substack.com/p/making-the-year-endless)

At this point I feel I need February to recover from the hangover of January. Why is January three months long anyway? And your last pay cheque was when? February is just four straight weeks. The shortest month of the year. Also, anyone who did make resolutions in the new year has given up giving them up by now. So they’ll no longer be a distraction. Time to make some resolutions.

## 2. Pick a Date

It can be any date, and it doesn’t have to be once a year.
> “So at moments in our lives that feel like **chapter breaks**, we have this sense that we're turning the page and that there's a clean slate that awaits us.” 
> 
> \- [Katy Milkman](https://www.katymilkman.com/) via [Masters of Scale: The Science of Fresh Starts](https://mastersofscale.com/the-science-of-fresh-starts/)

Our lives are a story, each paragraph or two a day. Weeks and months pass a few pages at a time. Those bigger occasions like passing of seasons or as our years progress, mark the chapters in our lives.

> “And at those break points, including the start of a new year, the celebration of a birthday, even the start of a new week, we feel like we're further from our past self. You know, who I was last year, that was the old me, **this is the new me**, or who I was last week, that was the old me, this is the new me.” 
> 
> \- [Katy Milkman](https://www.katymilkman.com/) via [Hidden Brain: You, But Better](https://www.hiddenbrain.org/podcast/you-but-better/)

Each year offer more than a few perfect opportunities to make a resolution or two. But be warned, this “Fresh start effect” has its downsides. As Milkman goes on to suggest, acting on these points in time only gives you a temporary boost to meeting your goals.

## 3. I Don’t Have the Time.

You really don’t.

Or to put it another way. 

> The average human lifespan is absurdly, terrifyingly, insultingly short. 

This is the first line of [Oliver Burkeman’s](https://www.oliverburkeman.com/) book [Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals](https://www.oliverburkeman.com/fourthousandweeks)[^2]. He argues that, rather than trying to do more, you really should do less. Make some honest and considered choices and you’ll actually succeed in what you really want out of life. Whatever that is for you.

[^2]: This book truly changed my perspective on life. I could really do with reading it again.

4,000 weeks is (roughly) all you have. From start to finish. It’s not long. Maybe just make one resolution this year.

## 4. Resolutely Resolve the Resolution 

Resolutions are fine, actionable plans are better. 

Thinking about the when and the where is a start. The more detailed the plan, the more likely it is to succeed. The how and why, however, are the more interesting and challenging parts to overcome. 

> “If you’re thinking of embracing a new resolution, ask yourself, “Why haven’t I been doing this already? What has been stopping me?” Answer those questions, and you might learn something that will help make your new resolution stick.”
> 
> \- [Tim Harford: How to Make Resolutions Stick](https://timharford.com/2022/03/how-to-make-resolutions-stick/)

Tim explores this further in his [blog post](https://timharford.com/2022/03/how-to-make-resolutions-stick/). If you figure out what obstacles have been standing in your way then you can build your plan around creating new routines to circumnavigate whatever’s hindering you.

## 5. Dailyish ￼

The [Seinfeld Technique](https://lifehacker.com/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret-281626) is the classic don’t break the chain approach to goal setting that is lauded over by productivity gurus, especially the [secular monk](https://firstthings.com/secular-monks/) types. However Seinfeld had a different perspective of his own advice that differs from the common interpretation: 

> Seinfeld Technique has come to mean "work on what matters most to you, every single day, without fail." But to Seinfeld himself it mainly just seemed to mean that you have to put in effort, repeatedly, over the long haul. No wonder it didn't strike him as a particularly astounding system.
> 
> - [Oliver Burkeman: Why you should aim to do new habits 'dailyish'](https://www.oliverburkeman.com/dailyish)

Seinfeld believes putting the in work is the key to success. To him that’s a given. Those that followed believed more in the acts and rituals over effort. Like any religion, breaking its strict￼ rules, as you inevitably do, cripples you with the guilt and regret that follows in earnest. 

The alternate dailyish approach isn’t a cop out, Burkeman argues, it’s quite the opposite. “It involves surrendering the thrilling fantasy of yet-to-be-achieved perfection in favour of the uncomfortable experience of making concrete progress, here and now.”

Let’s step away from the ism of the Seinfeld Technique and just dedicate ourselves to putting in the work, as and when we can.

## 6. Joyful Joyful Motivation

I’m trying to write 25 minutes a day with limited success. After a year of trying I’ve only just worked out why that’s the case.

I’d love to write stories but have always struggled.[^3] They say ‘write what you know’.[^4] This is difficult for someone like myself with such a fleeting memory. So my first step in writing more stories was to create a growing collection of what I know.

[^3]: I’m not sure if I truly love writing stories or if I like the idea of writing stories. Even making this observation suggests the latter but I genuinely think there is a twist in the tale.

[^4]: I disagree. Actually the best stories come out of writers who ‘know what you write’ a subtle but fundamental different.

Each day pick out a story worthy moment, sentence or conversation that occurred, write it down with a few crib notes and repeat. Let the source material from my life grow. It worked a treat, except for one important point. I’d inadvertently ￼ started a journal of self reflection. At times, in fact, more often than not, it became quite a brutal and uncomfortable chore. Not the most joyous exercise to get myself back into writing.

So I’m trying a different approach. I’m still going to try and write every day but if I’m not finding joy in it I’ll write something else instead.

Don’t underestimate the presence of joy as a guiding light in choosing how to spend these precious few weeks on this mortal coil. ￼And you don’t have to wait until January to get going.

## Below the Cut

(*Or the bits that didn’t quite fit or make the cut.*)

The podcast from [A Slight Change of Plans](https://www.pushkin.fm/podcasts/a-slight-change-of-plans) inspired this post. Where [Dr. Maya Shankar](https://mayashankar.com/) and [Dr Laurie Santo](https://www.drlauriesantos.com/) discuss [How To Be Happier This Year](https://omny.fm/shows/a-slight-change-of-plans/how-to-be-happier-this-year). 

I’ve never heard the concept of confetti time. They argue you could utilise those snippets of time wasted between tasks. Actually, with a bit of reading around. It’s about preserving your big chunks of quality time by not getting broken by intermittent distractions, mostly of the digital variety. 

Austin Kleon and Oliver Burkeman having a [conversation together](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=J35B57ZOUhc&pp=4gcKEghzdWJzdGFjaw%3D%3D). For me this is like part of an answer to, who would you invite to a dinner party question, playing out in real life. There pragmatic and realistic approach to dishing out advice really aligns with my life view.

Successful 'secular monks' are rarely married with kids. Families tend to disrupt their perfectly formed routine of a life. Seinfeld on the other hand has a wife and three kids.
