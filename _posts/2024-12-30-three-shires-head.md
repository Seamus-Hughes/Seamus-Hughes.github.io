![Waterfall and bridge at Three Shires Head](/_images/three-shires-head-waterfall.jpg “Three Shires Head”)

Here’s the corrected version with spelling and grammatical errors fixed. I’ll explain all changes afterward:

The best walks we take as a family are the routes that could be lifted verbatim from a Tolkien novel. 

Three Shires Head falls squarely in that realm. Envision a well-worn but rugged path following a brook nestled between steep valley sides. You continue downward as the brook tumbles over rocky shallows, cascades down gentle falls, and gathers in plunge pools.

The waterway is a little too wide and deep to cross with a jump and a stride but just wide enough to tempt the more adventurous type. Before you’re overcome with such temptation, a couple of packhorse bridges appear, crossing where two streams meet. A fine scenic point to rest your weary legs and indulge in a snack.

My three little hobbits, like a good story, would not tolerate the same old scenery page after page. They need somewhere interesting to climb up, on, or over to keep their reluctant legs moving. That and frequent snacks, of course. The occasional interesting thing to look at now and again keeps the spirits high. 

Three Shires Head is a hidden gem that delivers on all fronts. A hidden gem only to ourselves, it seems. For everyone else, it’s been up there as one of the top walks around.

It’s one of [Peak District Kids](https://peakdistrictkids.co.uk/?ref22=peakdistrictkids.co.uk%2Fthree-shires-head-walk%2F%3Futm_source%3Dchatgpt.com)’ top downloaded walks, there’s a route in the wild swimming walk [book](https://wildthingspublishing.com/product/wild-swimming-walks-peak-district/) I got my wife for Christmas, and when asked, ChatGPT churned it out as a suggestion. 

Peak District Kids has been our main source for child-friendly walking routes over the past few years. We are more than happy to spend £1.50 on one of their [routes](https://peakdistrictkids.co.uk/three-shires-head-walk/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). 

We pass this location on our regular commute over to our parents, so we’ll return. When the weather gets fairer, we’ll pack the water shoes for some wild swimming or paddling for those who are less adventurous.
