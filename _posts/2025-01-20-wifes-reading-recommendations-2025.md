My better half managed to read 52 books last year. They were mostly here current genre of choose, psychological, page-turning thrillers. To broaden her reading horizons, she took to social media to ask her bookworm friends to help her compile 12 books to read this year. This [inspired me]({% post_url 2025-01-19-book-pool %}) to ask her for her recommendations for me. She kindly obliged.

Some of the books she has chosen are ones she read over a number of years. They're the books that had a significant emotional impact. Other books, the psychological thrillers, are some of her favorites from last year's shelf full of books.
