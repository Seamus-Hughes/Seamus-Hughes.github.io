Every time the [New Writing North](https://newwritingnorth.com/) newsletter drops in my inbox, I grumble to myself about how little of their resources and opportunities occur in my home town of Sheffield. I ignore the fact that the bigger problem is that I haven't done my 25 minutes of writing that I promised myself to do every day.

When the newsletter pointed me in the direction of their [Channel 4 Writing for TV awards](https://newwritingnorth.com/northern-writers-awards/awards/), my interest was sparked. As I cycled through my story ideas that bounce around in my head, none of them fit neatly into the TV format, nor were they the sort of thing that [Warp Films](https://warpfilms.com/) would go for. Yes, there are just round the corner. Yes, they might be in the [limelight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence_(TV_series)) a little. But the reason they jumped out at me as the one to go for is that I read [this](https://www.sheffieldtribune.co.uk/adolescence-how-a-struggling-sheffield-film-company-made-the-worlds-most-downloaded-drama/) from my local independent news outlet [The Tribune](https://www.sheffieldtribune.co.uk/) and thought it would be great to work there.

If only I could think up an idea of a story that would fit.

Before I left the house that morning, I'd had the germ of an idea. At lunchtime, I'd devised a working title, and a week later (which I have to say I'm quite proud of), as I've let it fester in my head, it's still got legs and is bursting to get out.

I did my 25 minutes of writing today, and some.
