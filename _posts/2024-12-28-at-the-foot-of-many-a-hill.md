I enjoyed reading [Alastair Humphreys'](https://alastairhumphreys.com/) book [Local](https://alastairhumphreys.com/local/) earlier this year, where he took his appealing concept of [micro adventures](https://alastairhumphreys.com/microadventures/) to a whole new level. Once a week, he ventured out to explore a small area on his local map.

His journal of explorations in his own backyard is very engaging.

He stepped out from his door, he looked and looked, and he looked some more until he started to notice. What he noticed surprised, amazed, and sometimes frustrated him.

It was his overriding thoughts and reflections on localism, our connection (or lack of it) with nature and adventurism that interested me the most. An interest I clearly share with the author, as he's now exploring these ideas in more depth in his new newsletter [Adventure + Purpose](https://alastairhumphreys.com/newsletters/). (I'd recommend his more general adventure newsletter, [Shouting from the Shed](https://alastairhumphreys.com/newsletters/).)

The book has ignited my imagination but I’ve yet to inspire myself into action.

Let's explore where my imagination has taken me and hopefully stick a pin in it.

The natural thing to do would be to copy Alastair's approach [verbatim](https://alastairhumphreys.com/local/), but where's the [fun](https://thegreenrunners.com/running-in-squares-how-to-find-adventure-on-your-doorstep/) in that?

Due to the nature of an adventure memoir, the exploring of locations, people, and nature that the writer comes across is as fleeting on the page as it is, I expect, on the cold February morning he is recounting. There were many times as I read when my story radar would be tweaked, and as he moved on, I'd be imagining taking a deep dive into what story that place or person really had to tell.

Maybe each square on the map has an untold story to tell. I genuinely thought seeking these stories out would motivate me. On reflection, I'd end up spending as much time, if not more, in the library than exploring nature on the doorstep.

I like a library; maybe as a little side project, I could visit every [library](https://libraryon.org) on my map.

I also like a good story. I couldn't shake the idea. I even contemplated exploring the [listed buildings](https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/map-search) in my local area. There must be a story or two there. That happens to be true in some cases, mostly because the buildings' age has given them the opportunity to collect stories. In reality, buildings get listed because of their [architectural relevance](https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/what-is-designation/listed-buildings/). Cycling to a farmhouse because its windows are designed a certain way isn't going to quickly keep its appeal.

Shouldn't we really have a story preservation society where places get a listing just for the significance of the stories they have to tell or represent? So the stories can be preserved.

When I couldn't muster up enough imagination to get in the way of me starting, I'd try to find some 'real' excuses.

The expanse of a map was bothering me a little. I only have the time between school drop-off and pick-up, which is 5½ hours.

What would be the simplest approach? Could I just [walk](https://congestionzone.wordpress.com/) every [street](https://alastairhumphreys.com/why-do-you-need-to-travel-round-the-world-when-you-can-walk-around-lewisham-living-adventurously-46/) in my [city](https://alastairhumphreys.com/run-every-street/)? I've enjoyed some urban exploration in my time, and I'd really like to [cycle somewhere](https://www.sustrans.org.uk/find-a-route-on-the-national-cycle-network/?location=null&distance=null&routetype=null) other than work. These ideas tie me more to the cityscape rather than landscape.

I could find the landscapes within the city. There seems an endless number of [parks and green spaces](https://www.welcometosheffield.co.uk/content/articles/a-greenground-map-of-sheffield/) I could explore. I could travel along the [five rivers](https://www.contourmapcollection.com/scrapbook/2023/11/20/city-of-rivers) of the city or search the many [woodlands](https://www.welcometosheffield.co.uk/content/articles/a-city-of-ancient-woodlands/) for climbable trees.

Quick side note: the tree idea comes from my eldest's obsession with climbing trees and me standing below trying not to worry about it. We keep saying we need to create a tree climbing preservation society. Maybe that's another side project.

I get out into nature enough with my family for us to wonder which was the best tree to climb. We do a lot of this local landscape stuff quite regularly, so initially, it would feel like treading old ground rather than new.

Some of my young clan do have an aversion to climbing hills. Maybe I could just travel to the [seven hills](https://www.rmcmedia.co.uk/vibe/watch-listen-do/article/In-search-of-the-seven-hills) that my city is so famous for.

Are there really [seven hills](https://mdfs.net/Docs/Sheffield/Hills/?t&utm_source=perplexity)? Maybe there are more, it definitely feels like there are more. Which brings me to where I've ended up. At the foot of many a hill.

If you get to the top of certain hills, you will encounter a [trig point](https://getoutside.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/guides/what-is-a-trig-pillar/). Once used to help map the country but now a relic of the pre-digital age. There are many, so many that people spend time [collecting them](https://trigpointing.uk). So I drew a 10-mile circle around where I live (using this [map](https://trigbagging.co.uk/trig-pillar-map/)) there happens to be 52 trig points within that circle.

Like I said, it's quite hilly where I live. So there we have it. Trig points are going to be the focal point for me exploring my local area one day a week for a year.

Do I really have the time to trek once a week to the middle of I-don't-know-where just so I get out and about?

I think it's time to take action. As [Alastair](https://alastairhumphreys.com/making-time-for-getting-outside/) says, "...if you're too busy to spend a few minutes sitting on a log in the woods, then you definitely need to spend a lot of minutes sitting on a log in the woods…"

It's time to find my trig point to sit on.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
