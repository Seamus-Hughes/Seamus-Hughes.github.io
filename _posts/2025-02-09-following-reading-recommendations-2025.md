This task proved more challenging than expected. AI tools like Perplexity and ChatGPT struggled to compile individual reading lists, so I completed the research manually. I discovered that people vary in their openness about book recommendations, with some lists coming from general rather than recent suggestions. Finding book recommendations from BBC employees, particularly those on Newscast or Americast, was especially difficult.

To improve next year's reading list, I need to listen more attentively when these individuals mention books that interest them and make notes accordingly.

I've made another significant observation. My influencers are predominantly middle-aged white men. This contrasts sharply with my other reading lists from my [wife]({% post_url 2025-01-20-wifes-reading-recommendations-2025 %}), [Children]({% post_url 2025-01-26-childrens-reading-recommendations-2025 %}), and  [Workmates]({% post_url 2025-01-27-workmates-reading-recommendations-2025 %}), who are all predominantly female. I clearly need to broaden my influences.
