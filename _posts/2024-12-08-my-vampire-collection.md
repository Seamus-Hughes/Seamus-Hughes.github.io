Where do we get our ideas from? I, like everyone else, am too tempted to ask.

This answer by Nick Cave warms my soul.

> Read. Read as much as possible. Read the big stuff, the challenging stuff, the confronting stuff, and read the fun stuff too. Visit galleries and look at paintings, watch movies, listen to music, go to concerts –  **be a little vampire running around the place sucking up all the art and ideas you can**. Fill yourself with the beautiful stuff of the world. **Have fun. Get amazed. Get astonished. Get awed on a regular basis**, so that getting awed is habitual and becomes a state of being. Fully understand your enormous value in the scheme of things because the planet needs people like you, smart young creatives full of awe, who can minister to the world with positive, mischievous energy, young people who seek spiritual enrichment and who see hatred and disconnection as the corrosive forces they are. These are manifest indicators of a human being with immense potential.

> Absorb into yourself the world’s full richness and goodness and fun and genius, so that **when someone tells you it’s not worth fighting for, you will stick up for it, protect it, run to its defence**, because it is your world they’re talking about, then watch that world continue to pour itself into you in gratitude. **A little smart vampire full of raging love, amazed by the world** – that will be you, my young friend, the earth shaking at your feet.
- Nick Cave, Letter to Ruben, aged 13. February 2023 [The Red Hand Files](https://www.theredhandfiles.com/im-13-in-a-world-ridden-with-so-much-hate-and-disconnect-how-do-i-live-life-to-its-absolute-fullest-and-not-waste-my-potential-especially-as-a-creative-also-what-is-a-great-way-to-spiritually/#) (***emphasis mine***)

When you get your ideas from everywhere and anywhere, you'll find yourself returning to familiar places: the library for your next book, the new exhibition at the local art gallery, a retrospective at the indie cinema, the radio show you've always loved. 

Behind each of these favorite places is a person. These are the collectors and keepers of ideas. It is their openness and love that motivates them to share. The generosity of these unsung curators deserves the credit for a good idea.

So, credit where credit's due.

I found the above quote in [Shaun Usher](https://shaunusher.com/) newsletter [Letters of Note](https://news.lettersofnote.com/p/be-a-little-vampire). Which I love and really need to get back into reading regularly. 

But hold on a minute, I don’t find it. [Lev Parikian](https://levparikian.com/) did. It’s from [issue 88](https://levparikian.substack.com/p/six-things-volume-88) of his brilliantly curated newsletter [Six Things](https://levparikian.substack.com/about). At least that’s where I stole it from. 

And what about [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/)? This quote feels like something I'd expect to find in one of his [well-curated musings](https://austinkleon.substack.com/) on creativity.

It resonates perfectly with his "Garbage in, Garbage out" section of [Steal Like an Artist](https://austinkleon.com/steal/), and he's quite partial to Nick Cave.

I’m so surprise he hasn’t shared it yet. I'll have to send it to him, he’d love this.
